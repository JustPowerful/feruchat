# Feruchat
`Note: the css is still in development, you'll encounter some css bugs, but the chat is functional.`
#### Description:
Feruchat is an open-source chat version of my old project 'feruferu' written in React and socket.io
if you want to implement other features you can collaborate, its free to use and open-source.

#### How to use: 
- This project uses `concurrently`, so you can run backend and frontend in the same command
You just have to change your directory location to `/backend` by typing `cd backend` and then you just have to run `npm run start`
- You can also edit global values in `Global.scss` like colors, border-radius of the chat messages (safe to edit)


#### Used libraries:
- Socket.io (Backend)
- React (Frontend)
- React-sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)
- React-icons
- React-scroll
